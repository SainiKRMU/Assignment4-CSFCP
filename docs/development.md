# Development Process

## Planning
The project began with choosing a simple application idea: a console-based To-Do List.  
The features were kept basic to focus on learning Git, GitHub, and VS Code.

## Environment Setup
- Installed Python
- Installed Visual Studio Code
- Installed Git and configured username and email
- Created a project folder and initialized a Git repository (`git init`)

## Coding
The application was developed step-by-step:
1. Created the main program file `todo.py`
2. Implemented a menu for user interaction
3. Added functionality to add, view, and remove tasks
4. Added input validation to prevent errors
5. Wrapped parts of the code in try-except blocks for safe execution

## Version Control
Throughout development:
- Git was used to track progress
- Multiple meaningful commits were made
- A remote repository was created on GitHub
- Changes were pushed regularly using `git push`

## Documentation
Finally, a `README.md` file and a `docs/` folder were added to document the project, as required by the assignment.
