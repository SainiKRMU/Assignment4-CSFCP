# Future Improvements

There are several ways this To-Do List application can be improved in the future:

- **Save tasks to a file** so that they are not lost when the program closes
- **Add task priorities** (e.g., high, medium, low)
- **Add due dates** or reminders
- **Allow editing tasks**, not just removing them
- **Add a graphical user interface (GUI)** using Tkinter or PyQt
- **Add color and formatting** to improve the console output
- **Allow categorizing tasks** into groups like Work, Personal, School
